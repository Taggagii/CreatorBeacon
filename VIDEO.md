intro motivation behind apps, why you created it
[ phone home screen ]
[ shows YouTube studio ]
- as a YouTube creator who is just starting out it's hard for me to connect with my audience in person
- even though I don't have many fans yet, I still want to form a deeper connection that we can simply through text
- At a a conference like Vidcon, there are so many people there it's impossible for me to get a panel or a booth where I can meet my audience

This need led to me and my friend creating CreatorBeacon

open app on phone

log in to creator account

show current giveaway, VidCon (YouTube conference)
- didn't have a large enough audience to be on a panel or get a booth
- but many of my fans are still attending so I created a giveaway for them
- they can enter for a chance to win some merchandise ( a shirt, some beautiful socks and a personal meetup at a cafe down the street)
[ add images ]
- oh, there we go we have some fans entering the giveaway
[ add giveaway in progress screen ]
- some more just entered
[ show qr code screen ]
ok, and I can go check the fan screen, and this is a qr code that I printed and posted somewhere where my fans have found it and are using their phones to enter the contest
[ show different phone ]
this is what my fans see when they enter the contest, this is my friend Josh entering the giveaway
oh, and it tells him that there is still some time left
after the giveaway is over, it tells that oh, he won a prize!
we're going to meet at a cafe down the street, I'm sure he'll love that and I'm excited to connect with him
so I can go back to my screen, here are all the winners, ok John won the shirt and Jill won the socks that's great

Ok, there are some fans who didn't end up winning the giveaway, I'm feeling generous I can give them another prize anyways

Ok, and that is Creator Beacon!
